# Cost Prediction On Acquiring Customers Using Random Forest

My team and I wrote this code as part of the final project for our machine learning course. This research illustrates the application of supervised learning techniques to analyze and forecast the cost of acquiring customers located in the United States by utilizing Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms. This work fulfills the course requirements and provides an example of a real-world application of machine learning. <br><br>
Based on the research results, it can be concluded that the best machine learning model to predict customer acquisition costs in the United States is the Random Forest Regressor algorithm. The results show that this model is very effective in providing estimates of customer acquisition costs, making it reliable for strategic decision making in business.
