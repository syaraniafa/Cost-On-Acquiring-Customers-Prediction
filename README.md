# Cost Prediction On Acquiring Customers Using Random Forest

My team and I wrote this code as part of the final project for our machine learning course. This research illustrates the application of supervised learning techniques to analyze and forecast the cost of acquiring customers located in the United States by utilizing Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms. This work fulfills the course requirements and provides an example of a real-world application of machine learning.
